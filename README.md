# Safe Updates

### Backstory
Recently, WordPress 5.3 came out which included quite a good number of outstanding improvements. I was excited and updated few of my installations only to find out that some of them ran into fatal errors.  Upon investigation, I discovered some plugins which were conflicting simply because they were not tested and incompatible with the update. I wondered, only if there was a plugin which could warn me about plugins or themes that might have not been tested, just before I tried to run updates.
